    "The python class `OpenAI` is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `openai.chat.completions.create()`, this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",

    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out the definition of \"LLMs\" including \"neural networks,\" \"attention,\" and \"the transformer.\" Hmm, let's start by breaking down each part.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that an LLM stands for Large Language Model. It's a type of AI designed to understand and generate human language. So, defining it as a flexible system capable of various tasks related to language makes sense. But I should make sure there's more detail to make the definition comprehensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the neural network part. Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure and function of biological neural systems. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes or \"neurons,\" which process and transmit information. The core components include input layer, hidden layers with activation functions, output layer, and a series of connections between these layers that can learn from data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, attention. I remember hearing about something called self-attention in the context of transformers within LLMs. So, attention is like how different parts of the model focus on different parts of the input at the same time. It's often implemented using multi-head attention, which allows multiple heads to simultaneously attend to the same set of tokens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The transformer refers to a specific architecture used in these models that processes sequences of data (like text) by moving through multiple segments and processing each segment in a parallel fashion. The key components here are self-attention and feed-forward networks. Self-attention captures the contextual relationships, while feed-forward processes information in a linear way without any recurrent dependencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, LLMs are neural systems that use attention mechanisms, especially those found within transformers, to understand and generate human language. They enable tasks like translation, summarization, text generation, and context understanding by learning from vast amounts of data and self-attentively generating outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I have a good grasp now, but maybe I should double-check if there are any other related concepts or variations in how attention is implemented across different LLMs. Also, ensuring that the definitions cover both the overall structure and more specific components like attention mechanisms might be important for completeness.\n",
      "</think>\n",

      "**Definition of Core Concepts Behind Large Language Models (LLMs):**\n",
      "\n",
      "A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is an artificial intelligence system designed to understand and generate human language, capable of a wide range of natural language-related tasks. It functions by processing inputs through its neural network structure, which includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Neural Network**: \n",
      "   - Comprising layers, such as input layer, hidden layers with activation functions, output layer, and connections between these layers.\n",
      "   - The core components include neurons in each layer that activate based on weighted inputs to produce outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Attention Mechanism**:\n",
      "   - Also known as self-attention, it enables the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously at the same time.\n",
      "   - Implemented through multi-head attention mechanisms, allowing multiple heads to attend to the same set of tokens independently.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Transformer Architecture**:\n",
      "   - A specific neural network structure that processes sequences (like text) by moving through several segments.\n",
      "   - Features self-attention for context-finding and feed-forward networks for data transformation in parallel.\n",
